                <h1>Core PHP </h1>
                <h5><b>Part I: PROGRAMMING WITH PHP :-</b></h5>
                <br>
                <p>The first part of this book is a thorough discussion of PHP as a programming language.
                    You will be introduced to common concepts of computer science and how they are
                    implemented in PHP. No prior programming experience beyond the use of simple markup languages is
                    necessary. That is, you must be familiar with HTML. These chapters
                    focus on building a foundation of understanding rather than on how to solve specific
                    problems. If you have experience programming in a similar language, such as C or Perl,
                    you may choose to read Chapter 1 and skim the rest, saving it as a reference. In most
                    situations, PHP treats syntax much as these two languages do. <br>
                    <b>Chapter 1</b> is an introduction to PHP—how it began and what it looks like. It may be
                    sufficient for experienced programmers, since it moves quickly through PHP's key
                    features. If you are less experienced, I encourage you to treat this chapter as a first look.
                    Don't worry too much about exactly how the examples work. I explain the concepts in
                    depth in later chapters. <br>
                    <b>Chapter 2</b> introduces the concepts of variables, operators, and expressions. These are the
                    building blocks of a PHP script. Essentially, a computer stores and manipulates data.
                    Variables let you name values; operators and expressions let you manipulate them.
                    <br>
                    <b>Chapter 3</b> examines the ways PHP allows you to control program execution. This
                    includes conditional branches and loops. <br>
                    <b>Chapter 4</b> deals with functions, how they are called, and how to define them. Functions
                    are packages of code that you can call upon repeatedly. <br>
                    <b>Chapter 5</b>
                    is about arrays—collections of values that are identified by either numbers or
                    names. Arrays are a very powerful way to store information and retrieve it efficiently.
                    <br><b>Chapter 6</b> is about classes, presenting an object-oriented approach to grouping functions
                    and data. Although not strictly an object-oriented language, PHP supports many features
                    found in OO languages like Java. <br>
                    <b>Chapter 7</b> deals with how PHP sends and receives data. Files, network connections, and
                    other means of communication are covered.

                <h5><b>Chapter 1. AN INTRODUCTION TO PHP :-</b></h5>
                <br>
                <p>This chapter will introduce you to PHP. You will learn how it came about, what it looks
                    like, and why it is the best server-side technology. You will also be exposed to the most
                    important features of the language.
                    PHP began as a simple macro replacement tool. Like a nice pair of shoes, it got you
                    where you needed to go, but you could go only so far. On the hyperspeed development
                    track of the Internet, PHP has become the equivalent of a 1960s muscle car. It's cheap, it's
                    fast, and there's plenty of room under the hood for you and your virtual wrench.
                    You probably don't need convincing that whether it's Internet, intranet, or extranet, the
                    Web is no longer about plain HTML files. Web pages are being replaced with Web
                    applications. The issue many Web engineers face is choosing among hundreds of
                    technologies.
                    This chapter will let you poke around the PHP engine, get your hands a little dirty, and
                    take it for a spin. There are lots of small examples you can try immediately. Like all the
                    examples in this book, you can easily adapt them to provide real solutions. Don't be
                    intimidated if you don't fully understand the PHP code at first. Later chapters will deal
                    with all the issues in detail.
                    This chapter talks about some things that you already know, like what a computer is, just
                    to make sure we're all on the same page. You may be a wizard with HTML, but not fully
                    appreciate the alien way computers are put together. Or you may find you learned all
                    these things in a high school computer class. If you get too bored with the basics, skip to
                    Chapter 2, "Variables, Operators, and Expressions."</p><br>
                <h5><b>The Origins of PHP :-</b></h5> <br>
                <p>Wonderful things come from singular inspiration. PHP began life as a simple way to
                    track visitors to Rasmus Lerdorf's online resume. It also could embed SQL queries in
                    Web pages. But as often happens on the Web, admirers quickly asked for their own
                    copies. As a proponent of the Internet's ethic of sharing, as well as a generally agreeable
                    person, Rasmus unleashed upon an unsuspecting Web his Personal Home Page Tools
                    version 1.0.
                    "Unleashed upon himself" may be more accurate. PHP became very popular. A
                    consequence was a flood of suggestions. PHP 1.0 filtered input, replacing simple
                    commands for HTML. As its popularity grew, people wondered if it couldn't do more.
                    Loops, conditionals, rich data structures—all the conveniences of modern structured
                    programming seemed like a next logical step. Rasmus studied language parsers, read
                    about YACC and GNU Bison, and created PHP 2.0.
                    PHP 2.0 allowed developers to embed structured code inside HTML tags. PHP scripts
                    could parse data submitted by HTML forms, communicate with databases, and make</p>
                <h5><b>Que:- What Makes PHP Better than Its Alternatives ?</b></h5>
                <p>The skeptics are asking themselves, "Why should I learn PHP?" The days of static Web
                    sites built with HTML files and a few CGI scripts are over: Today's sites must be
                    dynamic. All the stale company brochures littering the streets of the Internet will
                    transform into 24-hour virtual storefronts or be swept away. The toughest decision facing
                    the creator of a Web application is choosing from hundreds of technologies.
                    Perl has adapted well to being a CGI solution and it has been used to drive complex Web
                    technology like CyberCash and Excite's EWS search engine. Microsoft provides its
                    Active Server Pages with Internet Information Server. Middleware like Allaire's Cold
                    Fusion is yet another solution. ServerWatch.com lists hundreds of Web technologies,
                    some costing tens of thousands of dollars. Why should you choose PHP over any of these
                    alternatives?
                    The short answer is that PHP is better. It is faster to code and faster to execute. The same
                    PHP code runs unaltered on different Web servers and different operation systems.
                    Additionally, functionality that is standard with PHP is an add-on in other environments.
                    A more detailed argument follows.
                    PHP is free. Anyone may visit the PHP Web site
                    <http: //www.php.net /> and
                    download the complete source code. Binaries are also available for Windows. The result
                    is easy entry into the experience. There is very little risk in trying PHP, and its license
                    allows the code to be used to develop works with no royalties. This is unlike products
                    such as Allaire's Cold Fusion or Everyware's Tango Enterprise that charge thousands of
                    dollars for the software to interpret and serve scripts. Even commercial giants like
                    Netscape and IBM now recognize the advantages of making source code available.
                </p>
                <h5><b>Interfaces to External Systems :-</b></h5>
                <br>
                <p>PHP is somewhat famous for interfacing with many different database systems, but it also
                    has support for other external systems. Support comes in the form of modules called
                    extensions. They either compile directly into PHP or are loaded dynamically. New
                    extensions are added to the PHP project regularly. The extensions expose groups of
                    functions for using these external systems. As I've said, some of these are databases. PHP
                    offers functions for talking natively with most popular database systems, as well as
                    providing access to ODBC drivers. Other extensions give you the ability to send
                    messages using a particular network protocol, such as LDAP or IMAP. These functions

                    are described in detail in Section Two, but you might find the highlights listed here
                    interesting. Because PHP developers are enthusiastic and industrious, you will
                    undoubtedly find more extensions have been added since I wrote this.
                    Aspell is a system for checking spelling. An extension provides support for numbers of
                    arbitrary precision. There is an extension for dealing with various calendar systems. An
                    extension provides support for DBM-style databases. You can read from filePro
                    databases. You can interact with Hyperwave. You can use the ICAP, IMAP, and LDAP
                    protocols. The Interbase and Informix databases are supported natively, as are mSQL,
                    Mysql, MS SQL, Sybase, Oracle, and Postgres. You can also parse XML or create
                    WDDX packets</p>
                <h5><b>How PHP Works with the Web Server :-</b></h5>
                <p>The normal process a Web server goes through to deliver a page to a browser is as
                    follows. It all begins when a browser makes a request for a Web page. Based on the URL,
                    the browser resolves the address of the Web server, identifies the page it would like, and
                    gives any other information the Web server may need. Some of this information is about
                    the browser itself, like its name (Mozilla), its version (4.08), or the operating system
                    (Linux). Other information given the Web server could include text the user typed into
                    form fields.
                    If the request is for an HTML file, the Web server will simply find the file, tell the
                    browser to expect some HTML text, and then send the contents of the file. The browser
                    gets the contents and begins rendering the page based on the HTML code. If you have
                    been programming HTML for any length of time, this will be clear to you.
                    Hopefully you have also had some experience with CGI scripts. When a Web server gets
                    a request for a CGI, it can't just send the contents of the file. It must execute the script
                    first. The script will generate some HTML code, which then gets sent to the browser. As
                    far as the browser is concerned, it's just getting HTML. The Web server does a bunch of
                    work that it gets very little recognition for, but Web servers rarely get the respect they
                    deserve. The medium is definitely not the message.
                    When a PHP page is requested, it is processed exactly like a CGI, at least to the extent
                    that the script is not simply sent to the browser. It is first passed through the PHP engine,
                    which gives the Web server HTML text.
                    What happens when the user clicks the stop button before the page finishes downloading?
                    The Web server detects this situation and usually terminates the PHP script. It is possible
                    to force a script to finish despite an aborted connection. You may also allow the script to
                    terminate but execute special code first. The functions to allow this functionality are
                    listed in Chapter 8, "I/O Functions," and Chapter 11, "Time Date, and Configuration
                    Functions."
                </p><br>
                <h5><b>Hardware and Software Requirement :-</b></h5>
                <p>One great advantage of Open Source software is that it provides the opportunity for
                    adaptation to new environments. This is true of PHP. Although originally intended as a
                    module for the Apache Web server, PHP has since embraced the ISAPI standard, which
                    allows it to work equally well with Microsoft's Internet Information Server. With regard
                    to hardware requirements, I have personally witnessed PHP running on 100-MHz
                    Pentium machines running Slackware Linux and Windows NT, respectively.
                    Performance was fine for use as a personal development environment. A site expected to
                    receive thousands of requests a day would need faster hardware, of course. Although
                    more resources are needed when comparing a PHP-powered site to a flat HTML site, the
                    requirements are not dramatically different. Despite my example, you are not limited to
                    Intel hardware. PHP works equally well on PowerPC and Sparc CPUs.
                    When choosing an operating system, you have the general choice between Windows and
                    a UNIX-like OS. PHP will run on Windows 95 and 98, although these operating systems
                    aren't suited for high-traffic Web servers. It will also run on Windows NT and its
                    successor, Windows 2000. For UNIX operating systems, PHP works well with Linux and
                    Solaris, as well as others. If you have chosen a PPC-based system, such as a Macintosh,
                    you may choose LinuxPPC, a version of Linux. You may pursue the commercial
                    WebTen Web server that runs in the Macintosh OS. Chad Cunningham has contributed
                    patches for compiling PHP in Apple's OS X. In 1999 Brian Havard added support for
                    IBM's OS/2.
                    PHP still works best with the Apache Web server. But it now works very well with IIS. It
                    also compiles as a module for the fhttpd Web server. You can make PHP work with
                    almost any Web server using the CGI version, but I don't recommend this setup for
                    production Web sites. If you are using UNIX, I recommend compiling PHP as an Apache

                <p>If you are using Linux, you can easily find an RPM for Apache and PHP, but this
                    installation may not include every PHP feature you want. I recommend this route as a
                    very quick start. You can always pursue compiling Apache and PHP from scratch later.
                    PHP will compile on most versions of UNIX-like operating systems, including Solaris
                    and Linux. If you have ever compiled software you've found on the Net, you will have
                    little trouble with this installation. If you don't have experience extracting files from a tar
                    archive and executing make files, you may wish to rely on your sysadmin or someone
                    else more experienced. You will need to have root privileges to completely install PHP.
                    The first step is to download the tar files and unpack them. The CDROM that
                    accompanies this book has recent versions of both PHP and Apache, but you may wish to
                    check online for the newest versions,
                    <http: //www.php.net /> and
                    <http: //www.apache.org />, respectively.
                    After unpacking the tar file, the first step is to configure Apache. This is done by running
                    the configure script inside the Apache directory:
